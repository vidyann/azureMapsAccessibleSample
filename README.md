# azureMapsAccessibleSample
There are two samples for Azure Maps here. Originally the code has been forked from Microsoft repo https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples. You can look at this Quickstart to quickly get started on Azure Map Service https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app

Both these samples are accessibility friendly, especially for visually impaired with screen readers.The Azure Maps Web SDK comes prebuilt with many accessibility features such as:
1. Screen reader descriptions when the map pans, moves and when the user focuses on a control or popup.
2. Mouse, touch, and keyboard support.
3. Accessible color contrast support in the road map style.
4. High contrast support.

Some of the above accessibility features are demonstrated in the samples below. Suggest exploring with a Screen Reader.
1. interactiveSearchSampleMap - Uses Azure Maps to create a map that gives an interactive search experience. Try searching for restaurants/shops in the search bar. The original sample from Microsoft repo has been modified to include easy keyboard navigation using tabs on search results important for easy accessibility
2. navigationControlOptionsMap - Uses Azure Maps to show all the map navigation controls on the map and how they react with different option settings.
